# Design-of-Haptic-sleeve-for-AR-VR-experience
Developing a Haptic Sleeve to enhance tactile feedback in AR/VR, enhancing immersion and realism for training, entertainment, and therapeutic applications.

#overview of project
The Haptic Sleeve for AR/VR Experience project aims to address the lack of tactile sensations in current AR/VR technology, providing users with a more immersive virtual environment. By incorporating haptic feedback into a wearable sleeve, users can experience realistic touch sensations that complement the visual and auditory elements of the virtual world.
